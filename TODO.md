## TODO (in order of importance):
- Change events in a user friendly manner
- Have importance levels of events
- Use something like "import time" and ".sleep()" to make code feel nicer
- Have a notification notify the user when an event is about to happen (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12575708/notification-using-python/45090702)
- Fix the bug of table characters sometimes not loading
- Allow the user to schedule events that are not on the hour (eg. 18:30-19:15)
- Have a way for multiple users to use the same application
